          From snuggly naps to monkey swings â€” our custom-milled microsuede is soft, safe,

          Our custom-milled microsuede is everything we dreamed of â€” soft like the Cushki hug,
          strong for fort building and tumble time, and machine washable to fit real-life messes.
          Itâ€™s cozy for kids, comfortable for grown-ups, and pet-ready too.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could talk all day about how much we love this fabric â€” because when you find
          something thatâ€™s beautiful, durable, and made for real play, it deserves to be celebrated.
          With Cushki, you donâ€™t have to choose between form and function â€” you get both, in every piece.

        <h2>Double-Brushed Microsuede</h2>

        <p>
          Our double-brushed microsuede isnâ€™t just soft â€” itâ€™s a feel-good experience.
          This premium material is brushed twice during production to give it a slightly raised texture
          (without being fuzzy), plus that slight shimmering softness that feels like magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s soft, itâ€™s rich, and it has the right amount of sheen when the light catches it.
          But itâ€™s not just about looks â€” the tiny grooves from brushing also help hide
          pet hair, crumbs, and dust. Perfect for families who love playtime just as much
          as cozy time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether youâ€™re building forts, bonding with your little ones, or simply relaxing,
          our double-brushed microsuede makes every moment softer â€” inside and out.
