        <h2>More Than Furniture — It's Playtime</h2>

        <p>
          Cushki™ is made up of modular foam pieces, wrapped in soft, durable microsuede.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's designed to be both furniture and a launchpad for endless play. Perfect for small
          spaces — even better when there's room to dream bigger.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Cushki™, we believe in more than just furniture. We're here to create magical moments,
          spark creativity, build lasting connections, ignite imagination, and transform everyday
          spaces into worlds of adventure.
        </p>
